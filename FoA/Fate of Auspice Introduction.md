## Gameplay

### Timing
The game is played on a day by day basis, with each day being spilt into three parts, with different actions to be taken at each part. First, there is the Morning, where the player can **only** gamble on a battle. Then there is the Afternoon, where the player can **gamble or interact with others**. Lastly, there is the Evening, where the player can **only** interact with others or proceed to the next day.
### Progression and Early Story
Throughout the game, the player will progress to higher levels of wealth and fame, and will slowly corrupt the battles they're betting on as they unlock new story elements. The player will first start with a small balance of money, and slowly accumulate more money through successful bets. After earning enough money, they will be able to afford their first gladiator, allowing the player to control a match, and take bribes to lose matches. ***This part of the game is designed to make the player comfortable with breaking rules to benefit themselves.*** After curating a roster of gladiators, the player will be able to interact with the politics of Rome, and gain even more control of the things around them.
### Technical Details
The gladiators in the game will be randomly generated whenever a fight begins. All their [[Attributes & Skills#Attributes|attributes]] are numbers generated 0-10, but other stats like popularity and vitality are influenced by factors such as attributes.
