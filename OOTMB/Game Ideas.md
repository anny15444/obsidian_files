## Gameplay Mechanics

In the beginning of the game, players customize their m-b skins[^1] from a [[List of bots]] . 1-2 m-b skins are given but the rest should be obtainable through playing/progression. After customizing your m-b skin, you will get assign one of 3 roles: personnel, guardian, and killer(Magnabot)

If you are personnel or guardian, you will be provided a random outfit to keep it anonymous. Personnel have to do tasks advised to them in different places to help stop the m-b.

Guardian(s) are unable to eliminate the m-b, so their purpose is to try and stun/prevent the m-b from killing the personnel.

The magnabots soul purpose is to try and eliminate/sabotage the players in time. Only when the killer pulls out some sort of weapon will they then be revealed as a magnabot. There will be ways over time that helps reveal the killer.

Plan to talk with andrew:  some sort of cooldown for the killer.
